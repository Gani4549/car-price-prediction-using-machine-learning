Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning is a data-driven project designed to estimate the market value of used cars based on key features and historical pricing trends. The system uses a structured dataset containing attributes such as car brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine capacity, and overall condition. After preprocessing the data through cleaning, feature encoding, and normalization, various machine learning algorithms—such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—are trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model. The model learns complex relationships between car features and their corresponding prices, enabling it to generate accurate price predictions for unseen data. Visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, distribution graphs, and feature importance plots help explain model behavior and data patterns. This project demonstrates practical machine learning workflow skills including EDA, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation. It is useful for buyers, sellers, and dealership platforms to make informed decisions and ensures transparency in pricing. The solution can also be deployed as a web application using Flask or FastAPI, allowing users to input car details and instantly receive a predicted price.
