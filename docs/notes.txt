This code loads a car price dataset and performs exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the data. It identifies numerical and categorical features, visualizes correlations, and checks the distributions of continuous variables along with potential outliers. Several categorical variables are converted into numerical form either by mapping text values to numbers (e.g., “two” → 2) or by applying one-hot encoding using pd.get_dummies. After feature engineering, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Regressor is trained to predict car prices based on the engineered features. The model is evaluated using common regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score. These metrics help determine how accurately the model predicts car prices. Overall, the script builds a complete data-processing and machine-learning pipeline to predict vehicle prices from various car attributes.
